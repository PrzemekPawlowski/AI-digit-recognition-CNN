This simple model predicts a handwritten number. After 5 epochs, 
the model predicts the number with 98% accuracy, the loss value is approx 0.03.
On the test data, we get an accuracy of 98%, which tells us that the model is not overfitting.

The file named "prediction_of_own_number.py" implements a simple way to use the model,
to predict the number from the image.

The model.py file uses a sequential model. In addition to the sequential model, we can use functional models. 
Then our network model will look like this:
